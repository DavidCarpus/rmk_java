<LI>I just clicked on shipping addres and it cleared the shipping address just entered and printed
<B>Yes, it does... it will be a LOT of work to change this. It clears that address any time you select ANY of the ship address options.</B>
</LI>
<LI>
when i enter SC in lower case as 'sc' as feature, should it prompt me to give option for charged feature?
<B>It only asks when you enter the whole knife. 
When entering feature by feature it should always ask to update the price unless it is a "free" feature. 
So, it basically does the reverse of what it does when entering a whole knife at once....It 'complains' if you enter a non-free feature.

The "taxed-Disc+Ship" column is incorrect. Showing 0.00 amounts and

This figure is a payment only and is not to be included in the

Sorry, I did not see this in earlier testing.  This is a column that is
shown in the old program and I should have carried it over to new
program.

calculating the discount, the new program does not recognize and 
include
KF and RS2 in the calculations.

New screen - phone this am,   the invoice number in the invoice is too light, needs bold and or highlite.<BR>
The bold blue highlite lines -- make the entire line white on blue. Invoice menu and payment menu<BR>

PROMPTING FOR CREDIT CARD NUMBER. We will not always have a Vcode. We need to be able to override, or enter false code xxx and the code not be saved.

After  entering the false Vcode,  we are prompted for the expiration date which is already  on file.  #56847.
I entered a false Vcode 123 at the prompt and it saves the number in data base--should not save.

PAYMENTS<BR>
<BR>
On Valerie's computer - When entering pmts. On new invoice, with credit
card # on record in the customer menu, the credit card number
automatically appears in field, then exp. Date.<BR>
<BR>
On Gary's computer, the expiration date field is not picking up exp. Date on record. <BR>
<BR>
Why the differences in the program on separte computers?  Also, now when he enters part #, 
it assigns $0.00 price. When he saves an invoice, the list is not updating.   Earlier this was not occurring. Please give us a call on this in the am.

<BR><BR>
INVOICE ENTRIES -<BR>
Add part number 'G10' to the 'ask price list of options, such as
CW,WT,etc.'<BR>
<BR>
When editing, highlited cursor should stay on item just edited after saved.<BR>
<BR>
When entering a knife model, and an unrecognized part number is entered, the program gives msg. 'invalid code'.  Then you return and go to next
entry screen.  We need to stay at the  model entry field with the invalid part # highlited (or something) to be able to correct and continue.<BR>

<BR>

When moving through the customer menu,  the fields or cursor needs to be highlited - cannot see !!<BR>

<P>When entering model and features, entered a WT-wrist thong. Next
screen-Kn.Qty screen, Next screen Kn.Comments, then Price screen---does
not relate to feature--- Need to identify feature being adjusted.   If
CW,CI,and WT entered, I will not know which feature price is being
adjusted.</P>

<LI>When the "note"  prints below the 'knife subtotal', it does not appear
	to be a part of the knife spec. Possible to program the 'note' to print
	directly under the last feature, and 'knife subtotal' same line as
	'note' or next line down.
<LI>The solid lines - ----   would like to see dashes - lighter shade.
