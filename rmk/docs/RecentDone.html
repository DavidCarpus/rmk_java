Entering payments and printing invoice
<BR>
Entered the 16digit credit card number, and the asterich and 3digit for
Vcode and expiration date.  When printing, it drops the first digit of
the Vcode. After further testing, if the Vcode begins with a '0', the
'0' is dropped on both Vcode and exp. Date.
<BR>
Reference existing inv.#46657, #46658,  - the ship to address is 
missing
state and zip code on invoice screen and when printing.

Invoice entries<BR>
<BR>
When entering an invoice, #57637, the invoice calucations are off 
again.
Shows price of $365.00 and the price of the knife (2004) price is
$315.00. <BR>
<BR>
Parts Menu<BR>
The "ask price" does not save once I exit program. Also does not save
when you upload.

ENTERING/EDITING KNIFE ORDERS<BR>
<BR>
EXISTING INVOICE #44753, SPORTSMAN'S SERVICES<BR>
I highlited one of  the "STANSP" to edit, deleted TN, then added TN.
The 'item number' takes the edited item and re-numbers it to the next
item number.   "Item number" should not change.
<BR>
Also, once an item highlited to be  edited and saved, the item changed
should remain highlited in the list.

SALES TAX SHIPPED REPORT<BR>
October 2004<BR>
The 'Due' column is showing the total amount of the invoice in ( ) if
paid.  Should show 0.00.  It did in the past.
<BR>
<BR>
SALES TAX ORDERED REPORT<BR>
Page 1 printing 2/3 page and went to next page--stoped at #57368 and
started page 2 w/#59393.
<BR>
The "taxed-Disc+Ship" column is incorrect. Showing 0.00 amounts and 
also
credits.   The 0.00 amounts are invoices that are existing, paid and
shipped invoices. Credits--see Invoice #57333, is an order for 2 kn.
Spaces, paid $40.00 deposit. 
<BR>
This figure is a payment only and is not to be included in the
taxed-disc+ship column.  We need to add an "amount paid" column.
Sorry, I did not see this in earlier testing.  This is a column that is
shown in the old program and I should have carried it over to new
program.

<P>	
Look at invoice #16287. Printed version shows 0.00 amount due.   The invoice screen shows $65.00 due.
Oct. 5
Invoice #16287-----Old rmk program is 0.00.   New RMK program shows
amount due.
Looking at the new program---Part number "KF"  and "RS2"  are no longer
part numbers. The first sub-total includes the  KF and RS2, but when
calculating the discount, the new program does not recognize and 
include
KF and RS2 in the calculations.
 
Would you be able to program a conversion statement that recognizes 
0.00
due  in the old program and automatically converts as 0.00 due in new
program?

<P>	
The  Balance Due letter is not working properly.<BR>
Data merges to Baldue letter, but the amount due is the 'erroneous' amount listed in the "Due" column for the invoice listings.<BR>
#55898 - logan baker, amount due is actual $525.10, shows a $4K figure from the 'due' column.<BR>
#46243, Wallace w. Armstrong, amount due is actual $440.04, and diff. figure shown amt due.<BR>

List of Invoices<BR>
List for Sportsman's Svc of Florida
The entire 'shipped' list.
Note the many invoices with credit amounts, #10081, 10600, 11005, 11437, 11519, 12085,plus.   
These are paid invoices with no credit due. Conversion problem.<BR>
			<B>Not sure how to deal with this. 11437 has a Misc item, which should be discountable, but the old system SPECIFICALLY has this 
			invoice entry marked as non discountable. This CAN'T be done at this pont in the new system. 
			A PART is either DISCOUNTABLE OR NOT.</B><BR>
