<P>
<OL>
<LI>the invoice notes printed over the 'thank you' on the order acknowledgement and not the invoice</LI>
<LI>THE COMPLETE ADDRESS IS NOT PRINTING ON THE INVOICE. NOTE THE COMPANY NAME AND STREET ADDRESS ARE INCOMPLETE WHEN PRINTED.
<B>The complete address, that was in the database, prints. The address "fields" are each 30 characters wide as the old system. 
I can make them larger but they are now what the old system was. Let me know.</B>
</LI>
<LI>i tried to return to last edited inv.#50137 and it was not at the top of the list, it was in the center<BR>
the last item edited should remain highlited when returning to invoice screen.<BR>
<B>This is a side effect of having to keep the information on the "list" up to date with any edits you make to an invoice. 
I can probably fix this but it will take time. Unless you let me know otherwise, I'll consider it a VERY low priority.</B>
</LI>
<LI><i>I am still investigating the "duplicate" invoices and the alt-'X' stuff not working.

<LI>after I enter a new part and it is automatically saved, the red save is still illuminated. If I exit w/o saving,yes, all the informati
