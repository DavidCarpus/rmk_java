<LI>the invoice notes printed over the 'thank you' on the order acknowledgement and not the invoice</LI>
<LI>THE COMPLETE ADDRESS IS NOT PRINTING ON THE INVOICE. NOTE THE COMPANY NAME AND STREET ADDRESS ARE INCOMPLETE WHEN PRINTED.
<B>The complete address, that was in the database, prints. The address "fields" are each 30 characters wide as the old system. 
I can make them larger but they are now what the old system was. Let me know.</B>
</LI>
<LI>i tried to return to last edited inv.#50137 and it was not at the top of the list, it was in the center<BR>
the last item edited should remain highlited when returning to invoice screen.<BR>
<B>This is a side effect of having to keep the information on the "list" up to date with any edits you make to an invoice. 
I can probably fix this but it will take time. Unless you let me know otherwise, I'll consider it a VERY low priority.</B>
</LI>
<LI><i>I am still investigating the "duplicate" invoices and the alt-'X' stuff not working.

<LI>after I enter a new part and it is automatically saved, the red save is still illuminated. If I exit w/o saving,yes, all the informati
information is still saved as it was auto. saved when entered.  The red save should not be on after auto saved.  Correct??
keeping in mind i have not made other changes in notes, discounts, or taxes.
</LI>
<LI>
the 'save'  is red after pmt entered. Payment has already been saved and no change made to invoice screen.  The save should not be re
be red, correct??

<OL>
<LI>NOTE i entered a model number in the feature list.  model numbers should be exclusive model entries and not able to enter under feature
features
</LI>
<LI>I just clicked on shipping addres and it cleared the shipping address just entered and printed
<B>Yes, it does... it will be a LOT of work to change this. It clears that address any time you select ANY of the ship address options.</B>
</LI>
<LI>
when i enter SC in lower case as 'sc' as feature, should it prompt me to give option for charged feature?
<B>It only asks when you enter the whole knife. 
When entering feature by feature it should always ask to update the price unless it is a "free" feature. 
So, it basically does the reverse of what it does when entering a whole knife at once....It 'complains' if you enter a non-free feature.
</B>
</LI>
<LI>
exiting invoice w/o saving, it took me to customer invoice list from the beginning. SHOuld return me to screen with only last two shipp
two shipped invoices
</LI>
<LI>
TOP LINE PRICE YEAR DEFAULT IS 2009, SHOULD BE 2005 WITH 2005 PRICE ON NEXT LINE
</LI>
<LI>
changed part number 'g10' to an ask for item. saved.   and it did not ask me for price on the next entry
<BR>
<B>You entered: 1-4,SS2,ns2,fch,asp,cw,g10,sfg,nsb,wt,mcb ... 
<BR>
Since you entered mixed case(SS2 was caps), and g10 was lower case, it set ALL the lower case features to $0. (Including the g10)</B>
</LI>
<LI>
after saving #47388, sends me to beginning of dealer invoice list, should start at last two invoices shipped
<BR>
<B>Fixed when fixing #4</B>
</LI>
<LI>
TERMS MUST BE ENTERED, OK,  SHOULD TAKE CURSOR BACK TO TERMS FIELD
<B>Same issue as the invoice dates being 'wrong'. The system displays multiple errors at once if there is more than one. Which error to go to?</B>

<LI>
entered 3-8, invalid model number, entered 3-7, accepted, but did not update to correct model number in the window and did not pr
prompt me to convert to uppercase charged features.<BR>
<B>Fixed the incorrect update... It only asks if you entered EVERYTHING in lowercase... 
It assumes if you actually changed cases that you know what you are doing.</B>
</LI>
<LI>
after entering an invalid model number, not able to enter correct model number. I entered 3-4 and tried to enter 3-5 to correct
and it did not recognize 3-5
