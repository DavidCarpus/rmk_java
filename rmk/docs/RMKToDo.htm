rmk reports<BR>
April 19, 2005<BR>
The old rmk program offers the following reports:
<UL>
<LI>CUSTOMER</LI>
<LI>INVOICE</LI>
<LI>ENTRIES</LI>

</UL>


The data fields for CUSTOMER:

Estimated date
<BR>
When entering a new invoice, and you enter a weekend date,  the window pops up ' estimated date is weekend'. <BR>
After you press ok the cursor should return to the 'estimated date' and the box be highlighted.
<P>

PREFERENCES<BR>
<BR>
The back log  number of months does not save.<BR>
The translation of the code, ups/tbd in 2009 does save okay.
</P>

<P>
<strike>
At this time the 'edit notes' on the invoice window appears every time
you enter and re-enter  the screen, for instance, after edit knife
entry, after payment entry.   Would like the 'edit note' to appear one
time only,  when you first open the invoice window.
</strike>
<BR><BR>
We did a pack and index at 1:00 pm today (Friday)
<BR><BR>
You had asked me about show stoppers.
<BR><BR>
Editing orders is a major function we use all day long. 
<BR><BR>
The knife entry seems to be working okay at this point. <BR>
The editing area is where the problems appear... and re-appear.
<BR><BR>
The blade list needs tweeking.  <BR>
. the features section and the comments section still override. For
example week of 5/26/05, inv. 47308, inv. 47398.<BR>
. issue with the 'lines' format.  For example 5/26/05, invoice #47308,
"all black spacers" should be on one line--not two.   We may have to
modify or eliminate the bolding and repeating of sheath specs. in the
comments to correct this and the override problem. Also the print does
not extend all the way to the left margin.
</P>

Invoice #58921 - ordered a #27. no problem entering order. Modified to
#12-6 lb. Saved. Model updated to #12-6 lb.  Pricing did not update on
the edit window or on the invoice window.   
<BR>
Then I tried to change model back to a #27.  The #27 is not listed in
the model options on the edit entry screen.  Something is wrong in the
parts menu with this item--see below.   
<BR>
I did check the Parts menu on the #27, it is listed in the parts menu 
as a 'blade item'.    
<BR>
If you look at the Parts menu 'parts list' of all the parts, the #27 is
listed as an 'unknown'.    
</strike>
<BR><BR>
Two issues here:
<BR>
Pricing is not updating on edit screen and invoice screen when model
number  is modified to any other model.   I tried two other invoices
#47739 and #49857 with same results. I tried changing to models other
than the #27 such as the #19 or the #23 with the same results.   The
pricing is not updating.<BR>
<BR>
<strike>
Parts menu - #27 listed as unknown and a blade item.  (also, The #27
does not appear in the entry edit screen under the 'models' list.)
</strike>

The save key is not saving in the preferences boxes. It stays green.
Some data is saved and some is not. Try to exit and a popup window
appears 'exit without saving'
<BR>
I tried to change 'backlog' from 12 months to 49 months. It saves on
screen, but not permanent. Green 'save'  stays on.   Exit and return to
preferences. Sometimes it saves and sometimes not.  Exit the program 
and return to preferences---not saved.
<BR>
Same with code key changes.
<BR>
What is the key to use the 'code keys'   in an invoice screen?   I 
tried shift and control  and neither work. Sorry, I forgot.
</strike>&nbsp<B><I> enter the "code" and it will convert when saved</I></B>

<P>
The 'customer #' should appear on the 'Customer Menu', (along with the
existing customer name and customer telephone number) where the merge
option is so that you don't have to go back and forth to look up this
number.
<BR>
Secondly, after the merge is complete, we need the application to 
delete the old customer.  There should be protection on the delete action,
where you cannot delete a customer if invoice files are attached.

Merging customers
<BR>
AT one time we talked about the function of merging two customers. 
<BR>
For example, We will have a customer living in FL and ordered five
knives in 1992.  
He called placed a new order in 2004 under new telephone number and
address, and used a middle initial.  RMK creates a new customer file.
Then we find out at a later date that this is the same customer that
lived in FL in 1992.  
We need the application to merge the 1992 invoices to his current
account.
</strike>
<BR>
<BR>
Also,<BR>
INVOICE BY SCHEDULED SHIP DATE - under reports menu
<BR>
We now have the option of estimated date and terms. 
<BR>
We will need to add more options, such as:
Discounted y/n (print discounted invoices)
Dealer y/n (print dealer invoices)
Invoice range, for example START INV. #40000- END INV. #40010
Telephone number or customer number - print all closed orders for this
customer, print all open orders for this customer, print orders within 
a specified year range.
<BR>
<BR>
<strike>
PARTS MENU
<BR>
Go  to model #27-5 3/4".<BR>
IN the red box, top of screen, listed as "handle material".<BR>
Look at the #27 in the long list and the part type is "unknown".<BR>
Unable to correct.

<BR>
we added this part a couple weeks ago to our line.  It appears in the

the default misc to 'handle material'.   The save button is not

<BR>
Entered #14-7 1/2,SS2,NS2,FCH,SFG.  Saved ok.

<BR>
To change to CDT, Go to edit screen, highlite 14-7 1/2 CDT from model
list, prompted to clear features, y/n, answer yes, press save.   In the
edit screen, the model now reflects the model 14-7 1/2 CDT, same
features SS2,NS2,FCH,SFG,(which is correct)    but price is not

There is a $15.00 difference between standard 14-7 1/2 and 14-7 1/2

 Hi Dave.<BR>
  <BR>
 Did you receive my email regarding the month end sales tax reports?
 (next paragraph)<BR>
  
  
 I tried to run the Sales tax reports, Ordered and Shipped, for December
 04.   The reports are incomplete. The shipped report shows only two
 invoices and the ordered report shows only four invoices - all
Invoices dated 12/24/04.<BR>
  
  
 Referring to the Invoice Reports:<BR>
 In the new program we have DATE and TERMS OF PAYMENT.   <BR>
 In the old program we were able to specify additional criteria for the invoices.  i.e.,  INVOICE START # AND INVOICE END #, DEALER OR NOT A DEALER.<BR>
  
 I recently had the application to run only half of a scheduled week due to a printer malfunction with the old program.<BR>
  
We ran the index on 12/24/04 but I noticed the new rmk has not been updated.  I'll  index again today.<BR>
  
Give us a call so we can set up a time to meet this week.   Gary would like to review and plan.<BR>

Exit invoice, then re-enter invoice and go to invoice notes---- the MC

Also on customer screen, telephone number, when saving, needs to insert
