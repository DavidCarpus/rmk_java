the last item edited should remain highlited when returning to invoice screen.<BR>
<B>This is a side effect of having to keep the information on the "list" up to date with any edits you make to an invoice. 
I can probably fix this but it will take time. Unless you let me know otherwise, I'll consider it a VERY low priority.</B>

Editing orders is a major function we use all day long. 
<BR><BR>
The knife entry seems to be working okay at this point. <BR>
The editing area is where the problems appear... and re-appear.
<BR><BR>
The blade list needs tweeking.  <BR>
. the features section and the comments section still override. For
example week of 5/26/05, inv. 47308, inv. 47398.<BR>
. issue with the 'lines' format.  For example 5/26/05, invoice #47308,
"all black spacers" should be on one line--not two.   We may have to
modify or eliminate the bolding and repeating of sheath specs. in the
comments to correct this and the override problem. Also the print does
not extend all the way to the left margin.

The 'customer #' should appear on the 'Customer Menu', (along with the
existing customer name and customer telephone number) where the merge
option is so that you don't have to go back and forth to look up this
number.
<BR>
Secondly, after the merge is complete, we need the application to 
delete the old customer.  There should be protection on the delete action,
where you cannot delete a customer if invoice files are attached.

We now have the option of estimated date and terms.

We will need to add more options, such as:
Discounted y/n (print discounted invoices)
Dealer y/n (print dealer invoices)
Invoice range, for example START INV. #40000- END INV. #40010
Telephone number or customer number - print all closed orders for this
customer, print all open orders for this customer, print orders within 
a specified year range.

Invoice #59414<BR>
William S. Talbot IV
<BR>
Entered #14-7 1/2,SS2,NS2,FCH,SFG.  Saved ok.
<BR>
I should have entered #14-7 1/2 CDT with same specs. 
<BR>
To change to CDT, Go to edit screen, highlite 14-7 1/2 CDT from model
list, prompted to clear features, y/n, answer yes, press save.   In the
edit screen, the model now reflects the model 14-7 1/2 CDT, same
features SS2,NS2,FCH,SFG,(which is correct)    but price is not 
updated.
There is a $15.00 difference between standard 14-7 1/2 and 14-7 1/2 
CDT.

Which Invoice reports where you refering to?<BR>

 Hi Dave.<BR>
  <BR>
 Did you receive my email regarding the month end sales tax reports?
 (next paragraph)<BR>
  
  
 I tried to run the Sales tax reports, Ordered and Shipped, for December
 04.   The reports are incomplete. The shipped report shows only two
 invoices and the ordered report shows only four invoices - all
Invoices dated 12/24/04.<BR>
  
  
 Referring to the Invoice Reports:<BR>
 In the new program we have DATE and TERMS OF PAYMENT.   <BR>
 In the old program we were able to specify additional criteria for the invoices.  i.e.,  INVOICE START # AND INVOICE END #, DEALER OR NOT A DEALER.<BR>
  
 I recently had the application to run only half of a scheduled week due to a printer malfunction with the old program.<BR>
  
We ran the index on 12/24/04 but I noticed the new rmk has not been updated.  I'll  index again today.<BR>
  
Give us a call so we can set up a time to meet this week.   Gary would like to review and plan.<BR>

Invoice # 46706
<BR>
Entering the credit card # on customer screen, adding to  Invoice 
notes,
printed ok.
<BR>
Exit invoice, then re-enter invoice and go to invoice notes---- the MC 
^
is not showing.  However, if you print the invoice again it will print.
<BR>
Also on customer screen, telephone number, when saving, needs to insert
the dash between seven digits
 xxx - xxxx.
