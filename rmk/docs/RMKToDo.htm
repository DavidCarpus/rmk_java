Customer screen:<BR>
<strike>
In previous email sent yesterday regarding entering 10.00 charge in Ship
charge box, I can only enter first digit, etc.  Well now also same 
problem in Shipping method box and ship to address box.
</strike>
</P>
<P>
Also regarding ship to address box. Refer to invoice #47184 in old
program. The ship to box, first line is 'same', second line is '
********final spec.change, third line is '08/04/04'.  Refer to inv.
#47184 in new rmk program and only first line is shown.

#58922,  Once again editing menu is not consistent with price year.
After I entered this invoice, tried to edit model #22 and price year
2004 appeared.  Exit and reenter invoice, edit #22 and price year 2005
appears.
</P>
<P>
Also, when in the edit menu, and I press escape, it closes out the
invoice and the edit screen still appears.  When pressing escape, the
edit screen should close, press escape again and the invoice screen
should close.

Invoice #58921 - ordered a model #27. No problem entering order.
Modified to #12-6" l/b, no problem. Tried to modify back to a #27 - and
the #27 is not listed in the model section.  It is listed in the parts
menu.  Unable to edit to a model #27.
</P>

Same invoice #58920 - exited program, reentered program, went to invoice #58920, edit menu, 
change from 14MINI to 14-7 1/2, price year is correct this time 2005, save. 
When the invoice screen appears, the "retail" box is not updated with current price.   
Sometimes it will update and sometimes not.
</P>


<h3>Wed, 23 Feb 2005 09:01:30</h3>
<P>
Invoice #58920 - new invoice, entered model #14, standard, pricing okay
at $300.00.  Went to modify to another model to check pricing year 
2005, and pricing year 2003 is displayed.  This problem occurred earlier this
morning also.  When you re-enter the edit menu the price year will
either be correct...or not. </BR>

When entering the ship charge on an existing invoice, I can enter only one digit. I have to highlight with mouse and delete to be able to enter the entire amount of $49.00.<BR>
<BR>
Example, invoice #47353, Sharp Stuff, Dealer, entering specs on existing invoice for his April order.<BR>
<BR>
We are ready to run parallel.  We will do an index/pack on Tuesday.  If
you will do an upload on Tuesday nite so we can run parallel begin Wed.
Feb. 23 morning.

 Hi Dave.<BR>
  <BR>
 Did you receive my email regarding the month end sales tax reports?
 (next paragraph)<BR>
  
  
 I tried to run the Sales tax reports, Ordered and Shipped, for December
 04.   The reports are incomplete. The shipped report shows only two
 invoices and the ordered report shows only four invoices - all
Invoices dated 12/24/04.<BR>
  
  
 Referring to the Invoice Reports:<BR>
 In the new program we have DATE and TERMS OF PAYMENT.   <BR>
 In the old program we were able to specify additional criteria for the invoices.  i.e.,  INVOICE START # AND INVOICE END #, DEALER OR NOT A DEALER.<BR>
  
 I recently had the application to run only half of a scheduled week due to a printer malfunction with the old program.<BR>
  
We ran the index on 12/24/04 but I noticed the new rmk has not been updated.  I'll  index again today.<BR>
  
Give us a call so we can set up a time to meet this week.   Gary would like to review and plan.<BR>

<P>
Invoice # 46706
<BR>
Entering the credit card # on customer screen, adding to  Invoice 
notes,
printed ok.
<BR>
Exit invoice, then re-enter invoice and go to invoice notes---- the MC 
^
is not showing.  However, if you print the invoice again it will print.
<BR>
Also on customer screen, telephone number, when saving, needs to insert
the dash between seven digits
 xxx - xxxx.
